# QuickDepotDownloader

QuickDepotDownloader is a program designed primarily for swiftly downloading previous versions of Rec Room from Steam. While it can be used for other Steam games by modifying the configurations in the bat file, its optimal functionality lies with Rec Room.

## Usage

To use QuickDepotDownloader with Rec Room or other Steam games:

1. **Configure the Bat File:**
   - Open the bat file and modify the `-username` field with your actual username.
   - Change the `-password` field with your respective password.
   - Note: Your login credentials are used solely for SteamDB access; I do not have access to your login information.

2. **Disclaimer:**
   - I am not liable for any actions taken using this program.
   - Please refrain from creating builds for 2023, as Rec Room does not permit this. At OldRecRoom.com, we uphold and respect Rec Room's rights.

## Important Note

QuickDepotDownloader can function with other Steam games by adjusting the app id and depot id within the bat file. However, it is recommended to use it primarily with Rec Room.
